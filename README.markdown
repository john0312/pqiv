PQIV README
===========

About pqiv
----------

pqiv is a powerful GTK 3 based command-line image viewer with a minimal UI. It
is highly customizable, can be fully controlled from scripts, and has support
for various file formats including PDF, Postscript, video files and archives.
It is optimized to be quick and responsive.

It comes with support for animations, slideshows, transparency, VIM-like key
bindings, automated loading of new images as they appear, external image
filters, image preloading, and much more.

pqiv started as a Python rewrite of qiv avoiding imlib, but evolved into a much
more powerful tool. Today, pqiv stands for powerful quick image viewer.

Features
--------

 * Recursive loading from directories
 * Can watch files and directories for changes
 * Sorts images in natural order
 * Has a status bar showing information on the current image
 * Comes with transparency support
 * Can move/zoom/rotate/flip images
 * Can pipe images through external filters
 * Loads the next image in the background for quick response times
 * Caches zoomed images for smoother movement
 * Supports fade image transition animations
 * Supports various image and video formats through a rich set of backends
 * Customizable key-bindings with support for VIM-like key sequences, action
   cycling and binding multiple actions to a single key

Installation
------------

Usual stuff. `./configure && make && make install`. The configure script is
optional if you only want gdk-pixbuf support and will auto-determine which
backends to build if invoked without parameters.

You can also use precompiled and packaged versions of pqiv. Note that the
distribution packages are usually somewhat out of date:

 * Statically linked
   [nightly builds for Linux and Windows](https://intern.pberndt.com/pqiv_builds/)
   ![Build status](https://intern.pberndt.com/pqiv_builds/ci.php)
 * Dynamically linked
   [nightly builds for Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE and Fedora](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:phillipberndt/pqiv)
   thanks to the OpenSUSE build service
 * [Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/en/sid/pqiv)
 * [Gentoo ebuild](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/media-gfx/pqiv)
 * [Arch AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pqiv/)
   ([Git version](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pqiv-git/))

If you'd like to compile pqiv manually, you'll need

 * gtk+ 3.0 *or* gtk+ 2.6
 * gdk-pixbuf 2.2 (included in gtk+)
 * glib 2.8
 * cairo 1.6
 * gio 2.0
 * gdk 2.8

and optionally also

 * libspectre (any version, for ps/eps support)
 * poppler (any version, for pdf support)
 * MagickWand (any version, for additional image formats like psd)
 * libarchive (for images in archives and cbX comic book files)
 * ffmpeg / libav (for video support)

The backends are per default linked statically into the code, so all backend
related build-time dependencies are also run-time dependencies. If you need a
shared version of the backends, for example for separate packaging of the
binaries or to make the run-time dependencies optional, use the
`--backends-build=shared` configure option.

Known bugs
----------

* **The window is centered in between two monitors in old multi-head setups**:
  This happens if you have the RandR extension enabled, but configured
  incorrectly. GTK is programmed to first try RandR and use Xinerama only as
  a fallback if that fails. (See `gdkscreen-x11.c`.) So if your video drivers
  for some reason detect your multiple monitors as one big screen you can not
  simply use fakexinerama to fix things. This might also apply to nvidia drivers
  older than version 304. I believe that I can not fix this without breaking
  functionality for other users or maintaining a blacklist, so you should
  deactivate RandR completely until your driver is able to provide correct
  information, or use a fake xrand (like
  [mine](https://github.com/phillipberndt/fakexrandr), for example)

* **Loading postscript files failes with `Error #12288; Unknown output format`**:
  This issue happens if your poppler and spectre libraries are linked against
  different versions of libcms. libcms and libcms2 will both be used, but
  interfere with each other. Compile using `--backends-build=shared` to
  circumvent this issue.
